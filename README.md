# BoseÂ® Connect App for Linux

--- Not Official App ---

Based on [Denton-L project][Denton-L], looks like it is not maintained. I
created a copy to have an active repository. This project keeps the original
license GPL-3.0.

If you own a Bose device, you'll know that `Bose Connect` is not available on
Linux. This program attempts to reverse engineer that app to give the device
Linux support.

## Build and Installation

### Dependencies

* BlueZ
    * `bluez-libs` on Arch Linux
    * `libbluetooth-dev` on Debian and Ubuntu

### Docker

Follow the next steps:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build \
  . \
  --file Dockerfile \
  --tag bose-connect-app-linux:latest

# Run the Docker image into container
docker run \
  --rm \
  --detach \
  --interactive \
  --tty \
  --name bose-connect-app-linux \
  bose-connect-app-linux:latest \
  /bin/bash

# Copy the build folder from the Docker container
docker cp \
  bose-connect-app-linux:/root/bose-connect-app-linux/build \
  $(pwd)

# Stop Docker container
docker container stop \
  bose-connect-app-linux

# Enjoy
./build/bose-connect-app-linux
```

The executable produced will be called `./build/bose-connect-app-linux`.

*Note: I created this in `Arch Linux`. It should be crash in `Ubuntu` because
the library of bluetooth is different, if it fails some fixes will come soon.*

### Local

The local build require the installation of the follow packages: `make`,
`cmake`, `pkgconf`, and (`bluez-libs` or `libbluetooth-dev`).

```bash
# Configure CMake
cmake \
  -S ./src \
  -B ./build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build
cmake \
  --build ./build \
  --parallel $(nproc)

# Enjoy
./build/bose-connect-app-linux
```

The executable produced will be called `./build/bose-connect-app-linux`.

### Install

Pending... ~~Run `make install` to install the program. The `PREFIX` and
`DESTDIR` variables are assignable and have the traditional meaning.~~
