# BoseÂ® Connect App for Linux

--- Not Official App ---

Based on [Denton-L project][Denton-L], looks like it is not maintained. I
created a copy to have an active repository. This project keeps the original
license GPL-3.0.

If you own a Bose device, you'll know that `Bose Connect` is not available on
Linux. This program attempts to reverse engineer that app to give the device
Linux support.

## Build and Installation

The executable produced will be called `./src/build/bose-connect-app-linux`.

### Dependencies

* BlueZ
    * `bluez-libs` on Arch Linux
    * `libbluetooth-dev` on Debian and Ubuntu

### Docker

Follow the next steps:

```bash
# Clean previous docker composes
docker-compose --project-directory ./src down

# Start the docker compose
export USER_ID=$(id -u ${USER})
export GROUP_ID=$(id -g ${USER})
docker-compose --project-directory ./src up --detach --build

# Build the application
docker exec \
  --user ${USER_ID} \
  -it bose-connect-app-linux \
   /root/bose-connect-app-linux/script/build-prod.bash

# Enjoy
./src/build/bose-connect-app-linux
```

*Note: I created this in `Arch Linux`. It should be crash in `Ubuntu` because
the library of bluetooth is different, if it fails some fixes will come soon.*

### Local

The local build require the installation of the follow packages: `gcc`, `make`,
`cmake`, `pkgconf`, and (`bluez-libs` or `libbluetooth-dev`).

```bash
# Execute the Bash script
./src/script/build-prod.bash

# Enjoy
./src/build/bose-connect-app-linux
```

### Install

Run `./src/script/install-prod.bash` to install the program, it will place in
the directory `/usr/local/bin/bose-connect-app-linux`. The
`PREFIX` and `DESTDIR` variables are assignable and have the traditional
meaning. For more information reefer to the [official web site][cmake-install].

Uninstall needs to run the script `./src/script/uninstall.bash`.

## Development Notes

For more information about the details of how use the firmwares to found
functionality, please review the file [DEVELOPMENT.md][details-file].

## Disclaimer

This has only been tested on Bose `QuietComfort 35's` with firmware 1.3.2,
1.2.9, 1.06 and `SoundLink II's` with firmware 2.1.1. I cannot ensure that this
program works on any other devices.
